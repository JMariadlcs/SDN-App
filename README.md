# SDN_APP
A SDN application development with basic implementation of IPv4 packets, ARP protocol integration  and ICMP protocol management

Software Defined Networking (SDN) application that implements the functionality of an IPv4 router and runs on the RYU controller. To demonstrate the operation, it will be supported in a network emulation environment over Mininet.


# Milestone 1

The objective of this practice is to reproduce the Layer 3 (IPv4) packet switching processes that take place in a router. (IPv4) packet switching processes that take place in a  router. To implement the complete environment, we will proceed incrementally:

I. Implementation of the routing table in the switch.
II. Implementation of the ICMP protocol responses on the switch
III. Implementation of the ARP protocol responses on the switch
